# Contributing to Arsenal

We appreciate your interest in contributing to Arsenal! Whether you are adding a new tool or improving the existing codebase, your contributions help make Arsenal better for everyone. Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration process.

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Begin by forking the Arsenal repository to your GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository where you can make changes without affecting the main project.

### Step 2: Create a New Branch

Create a new branch in your forked repository for your contributions. Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the nature of your changes, such as `add-new-tool-name` or `fix-tool-bug`.

### Step 3: Add Your Tool or Improvement

#### For New Tools:
1. Create a dedicated folder for your tool within the repository. 
2. Include all files necessary for your tool to function, such as scripts, configurations, or dependencies. 
3. Add a `README.md` file to your tool's folder. This file should provide:
   - A **clear description** of the tool and its purpose.
   - **Usage instructions** with examples to help users get started.
   - Details on **dependencies** and how to set them up.

#### For Improvements:
- Clearly document the changes you are making and the problems they address. Update existing files with clear explanations as needed.

### Step 4: Test Your Changes

Before submitting your changes, thoroughly test them to ensure everything works as intended. If applicable, include test cases or examples that demonstrate your contributions.

### Step 5: Submit a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Open a pull request to the main Arsenal repository. Ensure the pull request includes:
   - A **descriptive title** summarizing your contribution.
   - A detailed description of your changes, including:
     - What problem the contribution solves or what it adds.
     - How to use or test the changes.
3. Wait for a review from the maintainers. Be prepared to make adjustments based on feedback.
